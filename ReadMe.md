# Phone List Generating Script

This script is designed to iterate and create all possible phone numbers in specified geographic regions. By prompting the user for a country code and multiple area codes, it generates a comprehensive list of phone numbers, which can be saved to a file for further use. The generated wordlists can be used with brute-force tools.
